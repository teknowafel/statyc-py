# statyc-py roadmap
  
This roadmap is divided into three categories; now, in-progress, and future. The meaning of these category titles is somewhat self-explainatory, so I won't be going into detail regarding said topic.

## Now (7/26/20)
1. Multiple articles can be processed and laid out on the page
2. The page is mobile-friendly thanks to well-written CSS
3. Articles can be referenced by appending # followed by the article name to the end of the url
4. Fixing code block width and removing the shadow
5. A button at the end of each article to copy the permalink
6. The buttons at the end of each article are stylized
7. "Read More" / "Read Less" button to make scrolling through articles easier with fluid animations
8. Improved site aesthetics

## In-Progress (7/26/20)
1. Making post dates based upon the filename in yyyy-mm-dd format so that articles are automatically sorted by date
2. Adding a page menu and an "About Me" section

## Future (> 7/30/20) 
1. This could be your suggestion! Send your ideas in #suggestions to be voted on. Suggestions with a substantial amount of upvotes will be taken into consideration.
