4. Fixed code block width with removed the shadow
5. A button at the end of each article to copy the permalink
6. The buttons at the end of each article are stylized
7. "Read More" / "Read Less" button to make scrolling through articles easier with fluid animations
8. Improved site aesthetics
9. Page menu with a button for an "About Me" section
10. Stylized floating button to return to the top of the page
